My career goals include advancing within a reputable company by leveraging my degree in Business Analytics and Information Systems to drive data-informed decisions and support strategic growth. I aim to build a stable and rewarding career that provides a steady income, allowing me to support a family—including my future wife and kids—while enjoying a comfortable lifestyle. Achieving financial stability will enable me to take meaningful vacations, create lasting memories, and ultimately lead a life filled with happiness, balance, and personal fulfillment.
